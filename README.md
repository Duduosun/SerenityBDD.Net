# SerenityBDD.Net

An attempted direct port of the great Serenity.BDD java framework (http://www.thucydides.info)

All credit to the original authors

I am attempting to keep all their original code and techniques, apart from where java is not compatible with c#, or where established libraries have direct implementation.

for example
java properties enum has been converted to a type-safe enum pattern
injections will be replaced with castle.windsor (or similar)
